Loan Default Analysis Dashboard in Tableau
This project is an interactive Loan Default Analysis Dashboard built using Tableau. The dataset consists of 28,625 data points with features such as age, income, employment length, home ownership status, loan details (amount, grade, interest rate), and credit history.
Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze the factors that contribute to loan defaults and provide key insights into borrower behaviors, loan grades, and credit risk. The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders understand the relationship between borrower characteristics and default likelihood, assisting in better decision-making for loan approval processes.
Key Visualizations:
1.	Loan Default Overview: A pie chart displaying the overall distribution of loan defaults versus non-defaults.
2.	Loan Default by Loan Grade: A bar chart showing the default rate for each loan grade (A, B, C, etc.).
3.	Loan Amount vs. Income: A scatter plot illustrating the relationship between borrower income and loan amounts, with color differentiation between defaults and non-defaults.
4.	Loan Default by Employment Length: A line chart showing how default rates vary by employment length.
5.	Credit History Length vs. Loan Default: A heatmap indicating how credit history length correlates with loan defaults.
Interactive Filters:
•	Loan Intent: Allows users to filter by the purpose of the loan (e.g., car purchase, home improvement).
•	Income Bracket: Filters based on borrower income ranges.
•	Home Ownership Status: Differentiates between borrowers who own homes and those who rent.
Insights:
•	This dashboard helps identify borrower profiles with a higher risk of default and provides visual insights into the relationship between income, loan amounts, and default likelihood.
